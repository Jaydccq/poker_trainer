# Task Plan: Mobile-First Arrangement Flow

## Goal
Deliver a single-focus swipe flow with an optional full-zone toggle and a fixed bottom hand tray on mobile.

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Plan and setup
- [x] Phase 2: UI/UX research (ui-ux-pro-max)
- [x] Phase 3: Implement mobile stepper + hand tray
- [x] Phase 4: Review and deliver

## Key Questions
1. How do we enforce single-focus steps on mobile without impacting desktop?
2. How should the hand tray behave to stay thumb-friendly and readable?

## Decisions Made
- Use a horizontal swipe container by default with a toggle to reveal all zones.
- Fix the unassigned hand tray to the bottom on mobile with horizontal scroll.

## Errors Encountered
- None yet

## Status
**Completed** - Swipeable single-focus zones with full-view toggle delivered.
